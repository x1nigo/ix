# IX
This is my post-arch install script for my linux system. ***WARNING!*** This is still in its testing phase, be careful!

## Requirements
- A fresh Arch linux install
- A working internet connection
- Run this script as root
- Git clone this into your root directory

```
git clone https://github.com/x1nigo/IX.git
cd IX
sh IX.sh
```
## Note
You can open the `programs.csv` file with your preferred editor, and see if you want to add/delete
any of the listed programs before the installation.

## References
- This was ***heavily*** inspired by https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS. For the same reasons,
I got tired of re-installing my entire config every single time I had a fresh Arch install,
so I decided to automate it.
