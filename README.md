# Installation script for x1nigo (Ix)
This is my post-arch linux install script. This has saved me a lot of time
whenever I decide to reboot my entire setup/system.

## Requirements
- A freshly installed `arch linux` system.
- A working `internet connection`.
- Run this script as `root`.
- You need to have `git` installed so you can clone this
into your root directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/x1nigo/ix.git
cd ix
sh ix.sh
```
## Note
You can open the `programs.csv` file with your preferred editor, and see if you want to add/delete
any of the listed programs before the installation.

## References
- This was heavily inspired by https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS. For the same reasons,
I got tired of re-installing my entire config every single time I had a fresh Arch install,
so I decided to automate it.
